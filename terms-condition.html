             <p>If the goods are not ready for collection by the Carrier at the place and time agreed, a charge for 'Nothing to Collect' will be made. A surcharge of TK 50 will be applied if there is 'Nothing to collect'.</p>
             <p>Depending on the service and courier selected they will make one attempt to deliver a Consignment during normal working hours. If the relevant carrier cannot obtain a receipt at the relevant delivery point it may attempt to deliver and obtain an appropriate receipt at an address close to the relevant delivery point and, if successful, will leave at the relevant delivery point details of the address at which delivery has been effected. Some courier services do not require a signature to deliver the parcel and may leave the parcel in a place the driver deems as safe. It is the customer's responsibility to check Delivery Expert BD's site information to see if the service they have selected operates within normal business hours and if the service selected would require a signature upon delivery.</p>
             <p>If the Consignment has not been delivered, the Carrier will return it to their warehouses, after leaving at the relevant delivery point a request for the consignee to contact the Carrier to make alternative delivery arrangements. If no such contact is made within a reasonable time-frame the Carrier will either retain the Consignment or return the parcel and the customer will be liable for any additional charges that may be incurred.</p>
             <p>If, on attempting to deliver a Consignment to a school on a similar institution, the Carrier finds that such school or institution is closed for holidays or other reason, the Carrier may apply a storage charge for retaining the Consignment at its premises and shall be allowed a reasonable time to deliver the Consignment once the school or institution re-opens.</p>
             <p>The automated system books the collection as per the customer's request. Please note that collection date &amp; time is not guaranteed on any service. The collection will be made at any time between 8.00 AM-5.00 PM Saturday &ndash;Thursday (excluding Bank Holidays). FRIDAY collections are available on most services at an extra cost.</p>
             <p>All delivery times and days are shown on our site are estimates only and no guarantees are made unless the service you book is specified under 'Money Back Guarantee' services. Consignments may be delayed for reasons that are out of the control of both Delivery Expert BD and the particular carrier.</p>
             <p>Please note that most of our services require a Barcoded label &amp; Printed Address Label to be printed out and attached to the parcel. Manual paperwork (including handwritten address labels) must not be used.</p>
             <p>On the advised services the driver will leave a Waybill document that you may have to complete with the 'to' and 'from' address details.</p>
             <p>It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that all the details are correctly completed and displayed on the correct parcel and no claim or reduction will be made if the parcel is sent and the details were incorrect or placed on the incorrect parcel. It is not the driver's responsibility to check this information, so please ensure this is checked before he leaves.</p>
